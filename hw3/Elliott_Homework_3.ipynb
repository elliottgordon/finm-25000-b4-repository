    "\n",
    "1. **Describe the four factors**: Market, Size, Value, and Momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market: the relative exposure of a firm's stock return with a market portfolio (i.e. the S&P 500)\n",
    "\n",
    "Size: the size of a firm as measured by its market capitalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Value: the ratio of a firm's book value (assets - liabilities) to its market capitalization (B/M ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum: stocks that have a large price appreciation in one year continue to have high price appreciation the following year and stocks with negative or lower appreciation continue to do so the following year\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Are they constructed from portfolios going long stocks or portfolios that go long some stocks and short others?\n",
    "   - - They are constructed from portfolio that go long some stocks and short others/\n",
    "   - What is the point of figures 1–6?\n",
    "   - - The figures provide a visual understanding of the real returns based on the provided factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How is a “smart beta” ETF different from a traditional ETF?\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart beta ETF weighting schemes are based on firms' financial characteristics or properites of their stock returns whereas traditional ETF weightings are based on market capitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is it possible for all investors to invest in the Value factor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, via single stocks, factor funds, and broad market indices, every individual has he ability to invest in the Value factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How does factor investing differ from traditional diversification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than diversifying risk (covariances between stocks), factor investing intentionally exposes an investor to a certain type of risk that they deem to be an indicator of returns."
